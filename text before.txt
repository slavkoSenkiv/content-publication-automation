How to stay creative
As I have already said, being a not native speaker and having a large audience makes it a challanging task to write push notifications. Especially, when a new content comes every week. And,  when it has a lot of events that require push notifications. And, when events types are similar from week to week. It’s hard to be at least a bit creative.

But after a year of copywriting I came up with a few tricks that make the process less stressful.  Usually my push notifications have two parts. The flavor part to get player attention, and info part to give player an idea of what is going on. While the second part is usually straighforward the first one may be hard to came up with. So here are a few tricks that I use when I’m stuck.
1.Rhyme thing
There is a nice service called #rhymezone .com. If your enter a word that you want to rhyme, then pick advanced view - it gives you a list of words that may be usefull for your copy. The list even will be sorted ascending by the popularity. Here are a few examples:


For hugging day “PLUG a 🫂 HUG into your routine! Celebrate Hugging Day with…“
Or another holiday “💪 The body ACHIEVES what the 🧠 mind BELIEVES! Celebrate Mind-Body Wellness Day with…”
For the content with the word “orb” in its name “🔮 Wanna be the LORD? Roll this new ORB! 🔥 Join…
For Ortoberfest a mag was rhyming with “🍺 GRAM a MAG and CHUG. Score a special…”
2. images
I believe you know about image search tab in Google as well as you are familiar with Pinterest. Ttry to enter your keyword, add “quotes/phrases/captions” word, and hit enter. Both of these have a lot of images that have text on it about every possible topic. But there is even more usefull trick! When you find the good phrase - click on it, and these servises provide you with more similar or at least related content. For sure, not all of them are creative, quite a lot are have same text in different font. Start scrolling untill you find smething that suits you. Here are few examples that I found build with a help of these services:

3. Words play

4. rewrite prewious examples.
If your you are sending push notifications at least for half a year or your team was sending them before you joined the team  - there is a chance that you will end up with a solid creative copies bank. Especially when you write a few creaitives per promotion for a\b testing or just to pick the best later. In half a year you will end up with a solid creative bank with copies may be reused after modification. To pick potenrially usefull just use keyword search in a document or filtering if you store them in a table sheet.
5. emogies
Well, do not have much to say here! If you are stragling to find apropriate emojies for push notications, or you feel that there is more apropriate emojies that you have in mind - there is few services that can help you.
Enter a keyword in emojipedia.org and it will list down you all related emojies. If you click one it will show you more emojies related to that one.
Enter a keyword in emojicombos.com and you will be offered list of emojie collections related to the keyword. Looks like some user build these collections and other users rate them. So on the top you can see really usefull collection for your topic.
6. Next day improvements.
Copywryting is like a winemaking. If you leave copies and come back to them later - you can make them better. Do not write and publish on the same day in a short. Plus, searching and writing creatives takes a lot of mind power. But on the next day a copy where you stuck can be rewriten with a new ideas.
7.Typos and grammar
I make types a lot. Like 2 typos per 1 sentence. But there are few tools that help me to identify these and eliminate. As I white copies in Google Docs there is a cool built-in tool that checks spelling a grammar mistakes. Usualy I do not aprove surrestions with one click but rewrite the words again in order to built a happit to write them correctly. The second tool is Grammarly. I use it not as an option instead of Google built-in tool, but as a second checking frontier. Afther these, if a run date for these notifications is later then today I ask my wife to check it too. Usualy she can find 1-2 mistakes too, or shuggest better slang.

As conclusion I want to say, that while all these tips and tricks alone are not super usefull, if you use them together they can boost your creativity and spedup copywriting. For those who are not native speakers they are really helpfull.
