P1 What are game push notifications?“What are game push notifications” is my first post in a series about game push notifications Writing and targeting game push notifications is a part of my day-to-day routine or business-as-usual (BAU) stuff as we call it inside our team. While it looks like a pretty simple task at the first glance , it is a really time-consuming daily challenge for me. Mainly because I’m not a native  speaker and push notification  copies require at least a bit of creativity. But what makes the task even more responsible is knowing the fact that they have quite a big impact  on the game overall. Plus I deliver these copies to hundreds of thousands of players directly. So, it is a bad practice to underestimate the role of push notifications in a game growth,  game growth, or live ops activities. Let me start with an explanation of what game push notifications are and why they are so important. I believe that most of you are familiar with this thing. If not game-related then regular ones. For some of you, it may be even so familiar that it wakes up a bit of a disgusting feeling. And another part of you may not have that feeling because you just have your notifications turned off  for the apps or games whose notifications were too spammy. (I’ll look into this situation more closely in part 2)But basically, what push notification is in a nutshell - it’s a way to deliver the information to all or certain players when they are out of the game. Be sure to check the next posts in the push notification series2.
